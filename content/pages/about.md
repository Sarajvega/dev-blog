Hey! I'm a horticulturalist turned software developer. Curious by nature, I explore everthing that piques my interest. This is a space where I document my learnings and experiments.


I'm at the beginning of my career as a software engineer, having just finished my internship at Amazon and bootcamp experience at [Ada Developers Academy](https://adadevelopersacademy.org/) January 28th 2022, I now turn my sights to [ShopBop](https://www.shopbop.com/), which I'll be joining this year. I'm excited to continue to cultivate my skills and learn from all these smart people.

*Lycopodium clavatum - club moss. You'll be surprised by what you can see when you look down and look close.*
