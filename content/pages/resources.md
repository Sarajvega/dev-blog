## So you wanna become a developer?

Ha! Nerd!

First, touch some code if you haven't already. 

Open up the [developer tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools) in your browser and mess around. Find some things to play with. Get on [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news) and find a tutorial to try to follow. If you fail and are confused, great! Thats part of the process. Get used to that feeling. You will fail / be confused / be annoyed a lot in the beginning unless you change your mindset.

It is not an easy ask, but lean into your curiosity. If something breaks or you get a return you don't expect, try to curb your frustration by saying to yourself: "Oh interesting, I wonder why that is?". Extra points if you write that down. Document what you tried and what happened. Being able to remember what you did and what went wrong is a huge strength for a developer -- you need to have an idea of what you did before you can fix things.

I kept track of little happenings like that and reached out to my resources to find answers. Your resources can be anything, a person who codes, a discord server, or good ol' reddit. 

After that I'd recommend trying a course. This could be through your local community college, coursera, udemy, or my absolute favorite: [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). I hate paying for knowledge that you can get for free. TOP is valuable because it has a discord server where you can bug a bunch of people and work together with folks chugging through their cirriculum. 

After doing a course and being sure this is right for you, decide whats next. 

This could be:
1. Online masters
2. Bootcamp
3. Self study
4. even a bachelor's!

Talk to your family about what make sense. For me, it was not financially feasible to do most options besides a bootcamp or self study. So I started trying to figure things out for myself until I found a bootcamp that suited my needs!

### Blogs 
Here are some blogs that I found helpful for getting started:
1. [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/) - She has excellent tutorials for WordPress development (which is how I got my first taste of code) and now she's putting out great React content. Plus she's a midwesterner like me.
2. [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/) - If you've done *any* scrounging around for coding resources, you are bound to have encountered Julia's blog. Here's a well referenced post: [How to ask good questions](https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/).
