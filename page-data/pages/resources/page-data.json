Nerd!</p>\n<p>First, touch some code if you haven’t already. </p>\n<p>Open up the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">developer tools</a> in your browser and mess around. Find some things to play with. Get on <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Free Code Camp</a> and find a tutorial to try to follow. If you fail and are confused, great! Thats part of the process. Get used to that feeling. You will fail / be confused / be annoyed a lot in the beginning unless you change your mindset.</p>\n<p>It is not an easy ask, but lean into your curiosity. If something breaks or you get a return you don’t expect, try to curb your frustration by saying to yourself: “Oh interesting, I wonder why that is?“. Extra points if you write that down. Document what you tried and what happened. Being able to remember what you did and what went wrong is a huge strength for a developer — you need to have an idea of what you did before you can fix things.</p>\n<p>I kept track of little happenings like that and reached out to my resources to find answers. Your resources can be anything, a person who codes, a discord server, or good ol’ reddit. </p>\n<p>After that I’d recommend trying a course. This could be through your local community college, coursera, udemy, or my absolute favorite: <a href=\"https://www.theodinproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">The Odin Project</a>. I hate paying for knowledge that you can get for free. TOP is valuable because it has a discord server where you can bug a bunch of people and work together with folks chugging through their cirriculum. </p>\n<p>After doing a course and being sure this is right for you, decide whats next. </p>\n<p>This could be:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Online masters</li>\n<li>Bootcamp</li>\n<li>Self study</li>\n<li>even a bachelor’s!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Talk to your family about what make sense. For me, it was not financially feasible to do most options besides a bootcamp or self study. So I started trying to figure things out for myself until I found a bootcamp that suited my needs!</p>\n<h2 id=\"helpful-things\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#helpful-things\" aria-label=\"helpful things permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Helpful things</h2>\n<h3 id=\"blogs\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#blogs\" aria-label=\"blogs permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Blogs</h3>\n<p>Here are some blogs that I found helpful for getting started:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.taniarascia.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Tania Rascia</a> - She has excellent tutorials for WordPress development (which is how I got my first taste of code) and now she’s putting out great React content.
